<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have been a coder for over 40 years, starting on my dad's Commodore 64 programming in Basic in the 80's, learning CL and RPG
  on an IBM AS/400 in the 90's and 00's, and now working on Full Stack Web Development!</p>

<p>I have developed and maintained websites for various small businesses as a hobby, but now look forward to taking it
  a step further and making this a full time career.</p>

<p>When I'm not typing away code on a computer I enjoy playing music with my band <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063522483839">Who Needs Shoes</a>,
riding my motorcycles, sailing, rafting, camping, and hiking.</p>
